import { Agent, Portal, Message } from 'plazbot';

const bot = new Agent({
  workspaceId: "[YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID]",
  apiKey: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
  zone: "LA" // Use "EU" for Europe
});

const portal = new Portal({
  workspaceId: "[YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID]",
  apiKey: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
  zone: "LA" // Use "EU" for Europe
});

const message = new Message({
  workspaceId: "[YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID]",
  apiKey: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
  zone: "LA" // Use "EU" for Europe
});
```

### **Agent Methods**

### Add/Update Agent
The agent is the most important part of the SDK. Here, you'll be able to create AI agents with certain characteristics and deploy them across different channels, whether it's the AI ​​Portal, Widget, or WhatsApp. You can also use our agent in any of your internal business tools, if you wish.

```ts
    const agent = await bot.addAgent(config);
    const agentId = agent.agentId;
```

```ts
    const agentUpdated = await bot.updateAgent(`agentId`, config);
```
To work with the agents, there is a JSON file that is the initial agent configurator which has the following structure. It's not necessary to fill out the entire file, but you can configure your agent however you like.

You can train the agent however you need, either through our configurator or if you want to configure everything in a single prompt; it's not necessary to use all the fields in the config file.

We're also providing a basic file for you to use in the repository.

### Get Agents
Returns all agents within the workspace.

```ts
    const agents = await bot.getAgents();
    console.log("🧠 Agents:", agents);
```

### Get Agent By Id
Fetches details of a specific agent by ID.

```ts
    const agentById = await bot.getAgentById({ id: agentId });
    console.log("📌 Agent by ID:", agentById);
```

### Copy Agent By Id
Make your agent's copy

```ts
   const copyAgent = await bot.copyAgent({ id: agentId });
    console.log("📌 Agent copied:", copyAgent);
```

### Delete Agent
Deletes an agent and automatically removes its reference from any associated portals.

```ts
    // Delete Agent
    await bot.deleteAgent({
      id: agentId
    });
```

### Activate/Desactivate Widget
Activate your widget for your website immediately with an agent feature. When you activate the Agent field, you'll receive a response with the script so you can install it.

This feature requires a separate update from the agent update, so if you use it in the general update, it won't deliver the script.


```ts
    const result = await bot.enableWidget({ id: agentId, enable: true });
    console.log("🤖 Widget State:", result);
```

**How Change the agent.config.json**
```json
{
  "enableWidget": true,
  "darkWidget": true,
  "nameWidget": "Plazbot",
  "initialShowWidget": true
}
```

---

### **Portal Methods**

### Add Portal
Creates a new portal with UI configuration (title, subtitle, branding, etc.).

🚨 **Importat** - It's very important to associate an agent with a Portal for it to work. The portal must have at least one associated Agent; otherwise, it won't load and will display a message. Association is done using the following method in this documentation.

✅ **Benefit** With this portal, you can have as many agents as you want: one Agent for Sales, another for Customer Service, another for Support, etc.

```ts
    const portalCreated = await portal.addPortal({
      name: "Portal Histórico",
      zone: "LA",
      title: "Consultas Históricas",
      subtitle: "Tu fuente de historia confiable",
      logo: "https://storage-files-plz-latam.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/master/logo-plazbot.png",
      logodark: "https://storage-files-plz-latam.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/master/logo-plazbot.png",
      access: "direct", // or "form",
      theme: "light", // or "dark"
      disabled: false, // Disable the portal
      brandOff: false, // Disable the plazbot brand
    });

     const portalId = portalCreated.id;
     const portalUrl = portalCreated.url;
```

**Portal Fields**

| Name            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| name            | Portal name. Visible text for identification. |

| theme          | Field to declare the portal theme, whether it is light or dark. |
| disabled        | Field that deactivates and activates the portal. |

| zone            | The zone is a very important factor; it must match the zone in which the account is created. It can be of two types: LA /EU (Latam/Europe). |

### **Whatsapp Methods**
To work with WhatsApp, it's important to be able to configure the number in Plazbot. The configuration is done directly with Meta, so there shouldn't be any issues during the process. We can also help you associate the number through our communication channels, such as support@plazbot.com or Discord.

👉 [[(Whatsapp Configuration)](https://docs.plazbot.com/guides/primeros-pasos/conectar-whatsapp)]

### Send Whatsapp Message 
This feature is for sending simple WhatsApp messages. If you want to host a chat on your platform, app, or other site, this feature will allow you to record incoming and outgoing messages. This simple message is used when the conversation with the client is already active. You won't be able to send a simple message if the client is new or hasn't responded to you within 24 hours of your last conversation, or the timeframe they have.

```ts
   // Whatsapp message
    const whatsapp = await message.onWhatsappMessage({
      message: "What features does Plazbot have?",
      to: "52123456789" //"sessionId12345" // sessionId
    });
     console.log("💬 IA Response:", whatsapp);
```


### Send Whatsapp Conversation
When sending WhatsApp conversations, it's important to be able to create the template in Plazbot.

Marketing Section -> Templates.

We're currently sending templates without variables; we're developing the ability to send templates with variables. Remember that when creating the template, you define the files to send, the type of template, etc. With this feature, you only send the template name, and the service takes care of the rest.

```ts
   // Send a template message
    const conversation = await message.onConversation({
      to: "52123456789", 
      template: "welcome_plazbot"
    });
```

### Register Webhook 
This feature will help you maintain a conversation with your user. Register your webhook, and every time the customer texts the number you configured, the message and reference information will be sent to your webhook. The webhook is only for Whatsapp functionality.

```ts
   await message.registerWebhook({
      number: '51966446311',
      webhookUrl: 'https://hook.us1.make.com/xxxxxxxx'
    });
```

### Delete Webhook
Remove the webhook from the number.

```ts
    await message.deleteWebhook({
      number: "51966446311"
    });
```

## 📁 Files API – Add, Validate, and Delete Files

This API allows you to upload files (PDF, DOC, DOCX) and connect them to your AI agent so their content can be processed using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Files are analyzed and split into vectorized fragments that can be retrieved during conversation.

### ✅ `addFile`

Uploads a file and links it to an AI agent. The file content will be processed and stored as knowledge fragments.

| Field       | Type     | Required | Description |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `fileUrl`   | `string` | ✅ Yes   | Public URL of the file to upload. Only `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx` formats are supported. |
| `reference` | `string` | ✅ Yes   | A detailed description of the file’s content. Used to decide if the file should be queried. |
| `agentId`   | `string` | ✅ Yes   | The ID of the agent to associate the file with. |

#### Example

```ts
const file = await bot.addFile({
  fileUrl: "https://example.com/docs/contract.pdf",
  reference: "Service contract between Plazbot and Supplier.",
  tags: ['contract','','agreements'],
  agentId: agentId
});

console.log("📁 File Added:", file);

const validated = await bot.validateFile({
  fileId: file.id
});

console.log("✅ File Validated:", validated);

const deleted = await bot.deleteFile({
  fileId: file.id,
  agentId: agentId
});

console.log("🗑️ File Deleted:", deleted);

```
